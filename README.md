UC Berkeley - Module 5.1 try it activity


## Overview 
This project dives deeper into the coupon acceptance rate for bars, coffee shops, and other stores based on user data (demographics, buying habits, family info, etc.) 

## Personal exploration 
I explored the coffee shop field more as I was curious to know how likely Engineering vs. Students vs. other employment types would accept coupons!
